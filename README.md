# Microvolts OverVolt: Rewards Server

A faithful recreation of the Microvolts rewards system that restores the functionality of servers like Surge and THO. This implementation provides a complete recreation of the original game's reward mechanics.

## Compatibility

This server is designed to be compatible with the [MicrovoltsEmulator](https://github.com/SoWeBegin/MicrovoltsEmulator) server. It is intended to be used alongside it.

## Current Status

This project is currently under active development. The initial feature, the **Referral Wheel**, is implemented and functional, though it's missing a ****GUI****. Other features are planned for future releases.

- **Referral Wheel** (✅ Implemented - **GUI**  In-Progress)
- **Event Shop** (🔜 Planned)
