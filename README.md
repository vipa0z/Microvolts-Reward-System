# Microvolts OverVolt: Rewards Server

> **Note:** Development will be on hold temporarily as im preparing for the CPTS exam. Regular development will resume after the exam period. Thank you for your understanding!


A faithful recreation of the Microvolts rewards system that restores the functionality of servers like Surge and THO. This implementation provides a complete recreation of the original game's reward mechanics.

## Compatibility

This server is designed to be compatible with the [MicrovoltsEmulator](https://github.com/SoWeBegin/MicrovoltsEmulator) server. It is intended to be used alongside it.

## Current Status

This project is currently under active development. The initial feature, the **Referral Wheel**, is implemented and functional, though it's missing a ****GUI****. Other features are planned for future releases.

- **Referral Wheel** (âœ… Implemented, but integration with The EMU API is not yet complete)
- **Event Shop** (ðŸ”œ Planned)
