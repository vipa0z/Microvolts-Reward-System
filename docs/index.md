# Microvolts OverVolt: Rewards Server

This project is a rewards server for the game Microvolts. Its primary goal is to replicate and re-introduce popular features from older versions of the game and private servers that are no longer active, such as ToyHeroes Online. The server is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new features over time.

## Compatibility

This server is designed to be compatible with the [MicrovoltsEmulator](https://github.com/SoWeBegin/MicrovoltsEmulator) server. It is intended to be used alongside it.

## Current Status

This project is currently under active development. The initial feature, the **Referral Wheel**, is implemented and functional, though it's missing a ****GUI****. Other features are planned for future releases.

## Features

The long-term vision for this project is to implement the following features:

- **Referral Wheel** (âœ… Implemented - **GUI**  In-Progress)
- **Event Shop** (ðŸ”œ Planned)
- **Achievements** (ðŸ”œ Planned)
- **Hourly Play Time Rewards** (ðŸ”œ Planned)
- **GUI** (ðŸ”œ Planned)
