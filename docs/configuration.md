# Configuration

The server's reward systems are configured through JSON files located in the `configs/` directory. This makes it easy to add, remove, or modify rewards without changing the server's code.

### Configuration Endpoint

While not fully implemented for all features, the architecture supports a configuration endpoint that allows for dynamic updates to the reward items. This will eventually provide an easy way to manage rewards through a GUI or API calls.

### Manual Configuration

You can also configure the rewards manually by editing the JSON files in the `configs/` directory. For example, to add items to the referral wheel, you would edit `configs/wheel_items.json`.

Each configuration file should contain a JSON object with a key that matches the feature (e.g., `"wheel_items"`) and an array of item objects.

Example `wheel_items.json`:

```json
{
    "wheel_items": [
        {
            "ii_id": 12345, 
            "name": "Awesome Item",
            "duration": 30
        }
    ]
}
```

### Configuration Validation

To ensure the integrity of the reward systems, the server automatically validates all configuration files in the `configs/` directory on startup. The validation process includes:

1. **File Existence**: If a configuration file is missing, the server will create it with a default empty structure.
2. **JSON Structure**: It checks if the file contains valid JSON and the expected root key (e.g., `"wheel_items"`).
3. **Item ID Validation**: It extracts all item IDs from the configuration file and checks them against the `valid_items` table in the database. If any invalid item IDs are found, a warning is logged to the console.

This validation process prevents server crashes due to misconfiguration and ensures that only valid items are available as rewards.
