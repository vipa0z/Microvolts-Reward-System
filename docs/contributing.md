# Contributing

Contributions to this project are highly welcome! As the project is in its early stages, there are many opportunities to make a significant impact.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in contributing, please start by exploring the existing codebase to understand the project's structure and coding style. The documentation in this `docs` folder should provide a good overview of the key components.

## How to Contribute

2.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
3.  **Make your changes** and ensure they follow the project's coding conventions.
4.  **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

## Call for a GUI Developer

I am particularly looking for Someone to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the server. This GUI would allow Players and administrators to easily access or  manage the reward systems, view server status, and configure settings without directly editing files or using the command line.

If you have experience with web development (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) and are interested in this role, please reach out. Your contribution would be invaluable to the project.
